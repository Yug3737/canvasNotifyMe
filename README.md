# Canvas Notify Me (CNMe)
- A daily SMS HW reminder app to provide convenient Canvas HW reminders
- Inspiration behind CNMe: Missing homework deadlines during the past semesters due to not scheduling homework on time.
- Purpose of CNMe: So that students like me can schedule their upcoming homework easily using the Canvas API and can remain on top of their schoolwork.

## How to Use
- Go to [the Website](https://canvasnotifyme.onrender.com/)
- Enter your First Name, Last Name, Phone Number(to receive a hello text), your cell phone carrier.
- Enter the daily notification time you want your hello message only if you are a Student using Canvas LMS at a US university.
- If you just want to explore the website, you can leave the Notification Time field blank.
- After clicking submit, you should receive a text message from the email(cnotifyme@gmail.com) with a Hello!

## What's Next?
- Efforts are being made to automate the process of receiving an SMS daily on the chosen time. For this, the file dailyHW.py has to be run continuously on an external server.
