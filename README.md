# Canvas Notify Me (CNMe)
- A daily SMS HW reminder app to provide convenient Canvas HW reminders
- Inspiration behind CNMe: Missing homework deadlines during the past semesters due to not scheduling homeworks on time.
- Purpose of CNMe: So that students like me can shedule their upcoming homeworks easily using the Canvas API and can remain on top of their schoolwork.

## How to Use
- Go to [the Website](https://canvasnotifyme.onrender.com/)
- Enter your First Name, Last Name, Phone Number(to receive a hello text), your cell phone carrier.
- Enter the daily notification time you want your hello message only if you are a Student using Canvas LMS at a US university.
- If you just want to explore the website, you can leave the Notification Time field blank.
- After clicking submit, you should receive a text message from my email (yugpatel8767@gmail.com) with a Hello!

## What's Next?
- Efforts are being made to automate the process of receive an SMS daily on the chosen time.
- The authors of the project are trying to look into how to implement the OAuth2 protocol without vialoating privacy regulations to serve other students.
